# Machine Learning - II

## **Random Forests and Ensemble Learning**

### **1️⃣ What is an Ensemble?**

An **ensemble** is a collection of models working together to make predictions, rather than relying on a single model. The idea is that multiple models can complement each other and improve overall performance.

- Ensembles can consist of **different types of models** (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees).
- The most popular ensemble model is the **random forest**, which combines multiple decision trees.

### **2️⃣ Why Do Ensembles Work Better?**

Two key principles make ensembles effective:

### **🔹 Diversity**

- Just like a football team needs different players (defenders, attackers, goalkeeper), a strong ensemble needs diverse models.
- **Diversity ensures independence**, meaning that even if some models overfit, others can counterbalance the effect.
- In a **random forest**, trees are trained differently, ensuring that they don't all make the same mistakes.
- This reduces **variance**, making the model more **robust** and **less prone to overfitting**.

### **🔹 Acceptability**

- Each individual model in the ensemble should be **better than a random guess**.
- Even weak models (as long as they are slightly better than random) can contribute to an ensemble’s strength.

### **3️⃣ How to Ensure Diversity in an Ensemble?**

To build a strong ensemble, diversity can be introduced in the following ways:

✔ **Use different subsets of training data** (e.g., bagging).

✔ **Vary hyperparameters** across models.

✔ **Use different classifiers** (e.g., SVM, decision trees, neural networks).

✔ **Select different feature sets** for training.

### **4️⃣ Why Are Ensembles More Effective?**

- **Lower Variance:** Since individual models make different errors, combining them reduces the overall variance.
- **More Stability:** Ensembles are less sensitive to changes in training data.
- **Improved Generalization:** They perform better on unseen data than individual models.

## **Ensembles and Their Advantage**

### **Ensemble Overview**

Ensembles use multiple models (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression) to make predictions for a given data point. The final prediction is based on the majority vote from all models.

### **Why Ensembles Work Better**

1. **Lower Probability of Error:**
    - If each individual model is **acceptable** (i.e., correct with a probability of > 50%), the probability of the ensemble being wrong is **much lower** than any individual model.
    - The ensemble aggregates the predictions of individual models, reducing the overall error rate.
2. **Handling Overfitting:**
    - Ensembles reduce the risk of overfitting by averaging out the biases of individual models. For example, even if one model overfits, the chance that overfitting affects more than 50% of the models is very low.
3. **Majority Voting:**
    - In a binary classification task, the ensemble’s decision is based on the **majority vote**. If more than 50% of the models predict the correct output, the ensemble will be correct.
4. **Improved Probability of Correct Prediction:**
    - For instance, in an ensemble of three models, each with a 70% probability of being correct, the ensemble's probability of making the correct prediction is **78%**, which is better than any individual model (which has a 70% probability of being correct).
    - The ensemble’s performance improves as more models are added.

### **Coin Toss Analogy**

- **Correct Prediction (Heads) > Incorrect Prediction (Tails)**: In a biased coin toss, the ensemble’s correct prediction corresponds to heads, and incorrect predictions correspond to tails. The probability of getting a correct prediction increases as more models are involved.

### **Example with Three Models:**

In an ensemble of three models with a 70% success rate:

- The probability of the ensemble being correct (p) is **0.784**, while the probability of being incorrect (q) is **0.216**.
- The ensemble's performance exceeds the individual models because the chance of making the correct prediction is higher, and the chance of being wrong is lower.

---

## **Popular Ensemble Methods**

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve predictive performance. Here are some common techniques:

### **1. Voting**

- **How It Works:**
    - In **classification**, the output is determined by the majority vote from all models. If more than half the models predict a particular class, the ensemble predicts that class.
    - In **regression**, the ensemble’s prediction is the average of the individual model predictions.
- **Equal Weightage:** Each model has an equal say in the final prediction.

### **2. Stacking and Blending**

- **How They Work:**
    - Stacking and blending are forms of manual ensembling where the predictions from individual models are treated as input to a higher-level model (meta-model).
    - **Stacking** involves passing the predictions to a **level-2 classifier/regressor**, which assigns different weights to each model's output to make the final prediction.
    - **Blending** is similar, but typically uses a simple holdout dataset for validation instead of cross-validation.
- **Purpose:** These methods combine the outputs of multiple models, allowing the ensemble to learn from the individual predictions with varied weightages.

### **3. Boosting**

- **How It Works:**
    - Boosting is an adaptive ensemble technique where models are built sequentially, with each new model focusing on correcting the errors of the previous one.
    - It transforms weak learners into a strong learner by adjusting weights based on errors, improving the overall accuracy.
- **Advantages:**
    - Boosting can significantly improve the accuracy of weak models, making it one of the most popular ensemble methods.
- **Popular Algorithms:** AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, etc.

### **4. Bagging (Bootstrapped Aggregation)**

- **How It Works:**
    - **Bagging** involves creating multiple training subsets with replacement from the original dataset, each used to train an individual model.
    - The predictions of these models are then averaged (for regression) or combined via majority voting (for classification).
- **Advantages:**
    - Reduces the variance of high-variance models (e.g., decision trees), making them less prone to overfitting.
    - Easy to parallelize, which speeds up computation.
- **Challenges:**
    - **Interpretability:** With many individual models (e.g., decision trees), it can be difficult to understand the ensemble’s behavior.
    - **Dominant Features:** If certain features dominate, all models may become similar, reducing the diversity of the ensemble.
    - **Computational Expense:** Bagging can be resource-intensive, particularly with large datasets.

### **5. Ensembles in Regression**

- **Regression Ensembles:**
    - Like classification, ensembles can be used for regression tasks, where instead of majority voting, the final prediction is the average of the individual model outputs.

## **Introduction to Random Forests**

Random Forests are an ensemble method based on **bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregating) and are widely regarded as one of the most successful ensemble techniques, particularly due to their flexibility and performance. Here's a breakdown of how they work:

### **1. Bagging and Bootstrapping in Random Forests**

- **Bagging** creates multiple training subsets of data (called **bootstrap samples**) by sampling with replacement from the original dataset. Each tree in the random forest is trained on a different bootstrap sample.
- **Bootstrapping:** Involves creating samples with replacement, meaning some data points may appear multiple times while others may not appear at all. Each bootstrap sample typically contains about 40-70% of the original dataset.

### **2. Random Sampling of Features**

- **Random Feature Selection:** While splitting nodes in the decision trees, **a random subset of features** is chosen instead of considering all features. This random selection ensures that the trees are diverse, helping to avoid overfitting and ensuring that no single feature dominates.

### **3. Training and Prediction Process**

- For example, if you want a random forest with **10 decision trees**, you will:
    1. Create **10 bootstrap samples** from the data.
    2. Train each tree on a different sample.
    3. In classification, the final prediction is the **majority vote** across all trees, while in regression, it is the **average** of predictions.
- **Diversity in Trees:** Since each tree is built using different data and feature subsets, the ensemble captures a broad range of decision-making patterns, improving generalization.

---

### **Advantages of Random Forests Over Decision Trees and Other Linear Models**

Random forests provide several key benefits that make them superior to individual decision trees or linear models:

### **1. Diversity**

- **Independent Trees:** Because each tree is trained on a random subset of features, there is high diversity within the forest. This ensures that the trees are not overly correlated, which improves the overall predictive power of the ensemble.

### **2. Stability**

- **Lower Variance:** Random forests average the predictions of many trees, leading to more stable and reliable outcomes. This makes them less prone to overfitting compared to single decision trees, which are highly sensitive to small variations in the data.

### **3. Immunity to the Curse of Dimensionality**

- **Feature Subsets:** Since each tree only uses a subset of features, random forests can handle high-dimensional datasets more efficiently, avoiding the curse of dimensionality (where models struggle with many features).
- **Reduced Computational Complexity:** By limiting the number of features considered at each split, the algorithm reduces computational complexity, making it scalable to large datasets.

### **4. Parallelization**

- **Independent Trees:** Each tree in a random forest can be built independently of others, which makes the process highly parallelizable. This enables efficient use of multi-core processors, speeding up training time.

### **5. Out-Of-Bag (OOB) Error**

- **OOB Error Estimate:** When training each tree, it’s only exposed to 70% of the data (due to bootstrapping). The remaining 30% of the data, which wasn't used to train a given tree, can serve as a test set for that tree. The **OOB error** is the average prediction error across all training samples, using only trees where the sample was not part of the bootstrap sample.
- **Advantages of OOB Error:** The OOB error provides an estimate of the model’s performance that is as accurate as using a separate test dataset of the same size as the training set. This eliminates the need for a dedicated test set while still giving an unbiased performance estimate.

---

## **Comprehension - OOB (Out-of-Bag) Error**

In this section, we’ll further explore the concept of **Out-of-Bag (OOB) error** in the context of random forests and how it is calculated.

### **What is OOB Error?**

The **OOB error** is a measure of the model's performance that doesn’t require a separate test set. It is analogous to **cross-validation** error but is calculated using the data that was not used for training individual trees in the forest.

### **How Does OOB Error Work?**

1. **Bootstrap Sampling**:
    - Each tree in a random forest is trained on a different bootstrap sample of the dataset. This means that each tree sees a random subset of the data, and some data points are not included in the training set for certain trees.
2. **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Samples**:
    - For every observation (data point) in the training set, there will be some trees in the forest that did **not** see that observation during their training. These observations are considered **out-of-bag** for those trees.
3. **Making Predictions with OOB Data**:
    - Each observation is passed to the trees that **did not include** it in their training (the OOB trees for that observation).
    - These trees predict the class (or value, for regression) of the observation.
    - The final predicted class for each observation is the **majority vote** across all the trees that didn't see that particular observation. For regression, it would be the **average prediction**.

### **Example of OOB Error Calculation**

Let's go through the example in the problem to better understand how OOB error is computed:

- **N** = 100 observations (data points)
- **M** = 15 features
- Random Forest with **50 trees**

**For each observation:**

- For observation **N1**, suppose **10 trees** did not have N1 in their training. These 10 trees predict the class for N1:
    - 4 trees predict class **0**
    - 6 trees predict class **1**
    
    The final prediction for **N1** will be **1** (majority vote).
    
- Similarly, for observation **N2**, suppose **15 trees** did not have N2 in their training. These 15 trees make their predictions:
    - 12 trees predict class **0**
    - 3 trees predict class **1**
    
    The final prediction for **N2** will be **0** (majority vote).
    

This process is repeated for every observation in the training set, and the majority vote of the trees not trained on a specific observation determines the final class for that observation.

### **Calculating the OOB Error**

Once all observations have their predictions made by the OOB trees:

- The **OOB error** is computed as the **proportion of misclassified observations**:
    
    OOB Error=Number of Incorrect PredictionsTotal Number of Observations\text{OOB Error} = \frac{\text{Number of Incorrect Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Observations}}
    

The **OOB error** is an unbiased estimate of the model’s generalization error, as it uses the observations that weren’t seen by each tree to assess the model’s accuracy.

### **Advantages of OOB Error**

- **No Need for a Separate Test Set:** The OOB error allows you to evaluate your random forest without needing to set aside part of your dataset for testing, making it very efficient.
- **Efficient Use of Data:** Since the error is calculated using observations that were not used for training each tree, it helps fully utilize the training data.

## **Feature Importance in Random Forests**

In this section, we will delve into **feature importance** in Random Forests and understand how it helps in identifying which features contribute the most to the model’s predictions.

### **What is Feature Importance in Random Forests?**

In Random Forests, feature importance is a measure of how much each feature contributes to improving the model's predictions. It is typically calculated based on how much a feature decreases the impurity (e.g., Gini impurity) of the nodes in the decision trees within the forest.

### **How is Feature Importance Calculated?**

Feature importance is often referred to as **"Gini importance"** or **"mean decrease impurity"**. Here's how it works:

1. **Node Impurity**:
    - In decision trees, nodes are split based on features to reduce the impurity at each node. Impurity can be measured using metrics like **Gini impurity** or **entropy**. Lower impurity means a better split.
2. **Decrease in Impurity**:
    - The importance of a feature is determined by how much it decreases the impurity when it is used for splitting nodes. Specifically, for each feature:
        - The algorithm tracks how much the Gini impurity decreases when a particular feature is used for splitting a node.
        - The decrease in impurity is weighted by the probability of reaching that node (the proportion of samples that reach that node).
3. **Summing Across Trees**:
    - Since a random forest consists of multiple decision trees, the importance of each feature is calculated across all trees.
        - For each tree, the decrease in impurity for each feature is summed.
        - The total importance for each feature is the sum of these Gini decreases for each tree.
4. **Averaging Across Trees**:
    - After calculating the total importance of each feature across all trees in the random forest, the sum is averaged by the number of trees in the forest.
    - This gives the final feature importance score.

### **Intuition Behind Feature Importance**

The core idea is that if a feature is often used to split nodes and results in a large decrease in impurity, it is considered more important for making predictions. Conversely, if a feature is rarely used or does not significantly reduce impurity when used, it is considered less important.

### **How to Interpret Feature Importance Scores**

- **High Feature Importance**: Features that lead to large reductions in impurity are considered important. These features play a key role in making accurate predictions.
- **Low Feature Importance**: Features with minimal impact on reducing impurity are considered less important. These features might not be crucial for the model's decision-making process.

### **Benefits of Using Feature Importance in Random Forests**

1. **Feature Selection**: By identifying important features, you can eliminate redundant or irrelevant features, potentially improving model efficiency.
2. **Better Interpretability**: Understanding which features are important helps in interpreting the model’s behavior and decisions.
3. **Improved Performance**: By focusing on the most important features, you can reduce the dimensionality of the data, which may improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

## **Detailed Summary of Random Forests in Python**

In this section, you will learn how to implement Random Forests in Python using the **sklearn** library. The primary focus is on experimenting with key hyperparameters such as the number of trees (**n_estimators**) and the number of variables considered at each split (**max_features**) to enhance model performance.

### Key Steps and Process:

1. **Dataset Overview**:
    - The dataset used for the examples is a **heart disease dataset**. It can be downloaded via the provided link, along with the Python code that you can use to practice along.
2. **Initial Setup**:
    - Before diving into the Random Forest model, you are encouraged to understand the dataset and the preliminary steps involved in data analysis. This includes working with **multiple regression models** and a **decision tree** before proceeding with Random Forests.
3. **Building a Random Forest Model**:
    - You will build a model using the **RandomForestClassifier()** with arbitrary parameters initially to simplify the implementation and improve prediction accuracy.
4. **Visualizing the Model**:
    - Once the model is built, you will examine some sample decision trees to get an idea of how decisions are made.
    - The **Out-Of-Bag (OOB)** score is discussed to evaluate how individual trees in the forest perform.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - **GridSearchCV()** will be introduced for tuning hyperparameters. This technique helps optimize the performance of the ensemble model.
    - After tuning, you will observe the impact on the model's accuracy.
6. **Variable Importance**:
    - The importance of each feature in the random forest is discussed. This feature helps identify which variables are most important for predicting the target variable.

### Key Hyperparameters:

- **max_features**: Controls the number of features to consider at each split.
    - **Too low**: Trees become too simple, learning nothing useful.
    - **Too high**: Trees become similar, violating the "diversity" requirement of Random Forests.
- **n_estimators**: Refers to the number of trees in the forest.
    - As the number of trees increases, both **training** and **test** accuracy generally improve.
    - The important benefit of Random Forests is that the model does not **overfit** even as its complexity increases with more trees. This allows you to increase the number of trees without concerns about overfitting, as long as computational resources are available.

### Performance Considerations:

- As you increase the number of trees, the time taken to train the model also increases. This is especially true if you're fitting a large number of models, and understanding the time complexity is an important part of the process.

### Practical Application:

- **GridSearchCV**: In practice, **grid_search.fit()** is applied to the training dataset, and the model is evaluated on a separate test dataset.

## **Summary of Random Forest Regression in Python**

In this session, the focus shifts from using **decision trees** for regression analysis to **Random Forest Regression**, which is an advanced technique that overcomes the limitations of decision trees.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Decision Trees vs. Random Forests**:
    - **Decision Trees** are useful for regression tasks, but they have limitations like overfitting and high variance, especially with complex datasets. Random Forest Regression addresses these limitations by creating an ensemble of decision trees, which helps to increase predictive power and generalize better.
2. **Random Forest Regression**:
    - Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to produce more accurate and stable results compared to a single decision tree.
    - This model is particularly useful for problems where the target variable is continuous, allowing for more robust decision-making.
3. **Feature Importance**:
    - Like decision trees, Random Forest Regression can provide insights into feature importance, helping to understand which features are most influential in predicting the target variable.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - You can further improve the performance of your Random Forest Regression model by **hyperparameter tuning**. This allows you to fine-tune the model to achieve better accuracy and avoid overfitting.

### Practical Exercise:

- An exercise is suggested where you can perform **hyperparameter tuning** on the Random Forest model you just built to improve its performance.

    ## **Detailed Summary of Telecom Churn Prediction**
    
    In this segment, you will compare **decision trees**, **random forests**, and **logistic regression** models for a **telecom churn prediction** task. The focus is to understand how decision trees and random forests outperform logistic regression in terms of prediction accuracy for customer churn.
    
    ### Problem Statement:
    
    - The task is to predict customer churn for a telecom company based on 21 variables related to customer behavior. These variables include:
    
    The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., switch to another telecom provider). The target variable is **Churn**, where:
        - **Demographics**: Age, gender, etc.
        - **Services Availed**: Internet packs, special offers, etc.
        - **Expenses**: Monthly recharge amounts, etc.
        - **1** indicates the customer has churned.
        - **0** indicates the customer has not churned.
    
    ### Dataset and Code:
    
    - You will use three datasets for this exercise:
        - **churn_data**
        - **internet_data**
        - **customer_data**
    - Additionally, a **data dictionary** is provided to help you understand the features in the dataset. You can download the datasets and follow along with the Python code to build the models.
    
    ### Process Overview:
    
    1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
        - Before building the model, you are advised to review the data cleaning steps and initial preparations from the previous Python notebook. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
    2. **Building Decision Trees**:
        - **Decision Trees** are implemented first to predict churn. Decision trees are easy to interpret but may suffer from overfitting due to their high variance.
        - Without significant effort in feature scaling, multicollinearity, or feature selection, decision trees still provide impressive results compared to logistic regression, as seen in the video.
    3. **Building Random Forests**:
        - **Random Forests** are introduced next, as an ensemble method that improves on decision trees by reducing variance and boosting performance.
        - **Random Forests** provide better results than both decision trees and logistic regression models. They leverage the predictive power of multiple decision trees, making them more accurate with much less effort. However, random forests lack interpretability when compared to logistic regression, as they do not clearly show the importance of individual features and their direction of influence on the target.
    4. **Comparison with Logistic Regression**:
        - **Logistic Regression** is used as a baseline model for churn prediction. While it performs well and provides clear interpretation of feature effects (e.g., odds ratios), it may not capture complex patterns as effectively as decision trees and random forests.
        - **Decision Trees** offer a more flexible approach by handling non-linear relationships, while **Random Forests** further enhance performance by averaging predictions from multiple trees.
    
    ### Trade-offs and Limitations:
    
    - **Decision Trees**:
        - High variance, meaning they can change rapidly with small changes in the data.
        - Easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.
    - **Random Forests**:
        - Improve upon decision trees by reducing variance through averaging multiple trees.
        - Lack interpretability in terms of feature importance, unlike logistic regression.
    - **Logistic Regression**:
        - Provides clear interpretation of feature effects but may not capture complex patterns effectively.
    
    ### Conclusion:
    
    - **Random Forests** outperform both logistic regression and decision trees in this churn prediction task. They offer significant improvements with minimal effort, but at the cost of reduced interpretability. If model interpretation is critical, logistic regression is more useful. If predictive power is the main goal, random forests are the best choice.
